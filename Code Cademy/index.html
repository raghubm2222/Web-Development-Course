      HTML and CSS form the foundation of modern web development. HTML defines
      how a web page is structured, and CSS defines its style. While both
      languages are relatively easy to learn, once you know the basics, you'll
      still need to sharpen your skills with practice.

    <p>
      Code challenges are a great way to sharpen your programming skills and
      combine them in different ways. Here are 10 HTML and CSS code challenges
      that'll help you take your skills to the next level. To get started, just
      pick a challenge, open up a workspace, and start coding.
